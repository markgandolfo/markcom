It involved testing our machine learning model to a sort of inventory that differs significantly from traditional hotels regarding room configurations, capacity amenities, and pricing.</p><p>Trivago has a long lasting history with the use of data and I highly recommend you read their <a href='https://tech.trivago.com/blog' target='_blank'>tech blog</a> to get a deeper view of how trivago uses data to improve its product.</p><p>I also found this <a href='https://tech.trivago.com/post/2023-02-24-ranking-algorithms' target='_blank'>article</a> which provides an example of how a ranking algorithm works.</p>"
