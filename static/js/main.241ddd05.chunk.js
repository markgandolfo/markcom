What is the Ebbinghaus curve, I can never remember?\\n2. Can money motivate people? The short answer is .. sometimes.\\n\\n## What is the Ebbinghaus curve\\nHave you ever wondered why you can\'t seem to hold onto information? Or how things seem to fade quickly once you\'ve learn them.\\nEbbinghaus ran some experiments on himself - he tried to memorise short nonsense words - and then tested his retention at later time intervals.\\nHe remembered 100% immediately after learning, then he noticed he started forgetting words really fast. In 20 minutes, 42% was gone. In 24 hours, 67%. In a month, 79% gone!\\n\\nHere\u2019s a chart of the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve.\\n\\n<img src=\'article_images/blog/20200706/forgetting_curve.png\' width=\'100%\' />\\n\\nEbbinghaus suggests two methods to improve the retention rate. \\n\\n1. **Spaced repetition**: where you revisit the same information at regular intervals. \\n2. **Mnemonic devices**: identify patterns in letters, sounds, or ideas to help remember.\\n\\n[There\'s a lot of research available, have a read, it\'s interesting stuff](https://www.google.com/search?q=ebbinghaus+curve+of+forgetting)\\n\\n\\n## Can money motivate people? The short answer is .. sometimes.\\n\\nThe psychologist Karl Duncker, created an interesting experiment (later known as Duncker\'s Candle Problem)\\n\\nThe participants are given a box of tacks, a candle and matches with the instructions to attach the lit candle to the wall, ensuring the wax doesn\'t drip on the table. \\n\\nWhen offered an extrinsic reward and timed, it was found that the higher the reward the longer it would take the participants to complete the task.\\n\\n<img src=\'article_images/blog/20200706/candle-01.png\' width=\'100%\' />\\n\\nThe experiment was repeated with the tacks outside the box, and the same reward system was given, and he found the completion time was similar whether a reward was given or not.\\n\\n<img src=\'article_images/blog/20200706/candle-02.png\' width=\'100%\' />\\n\\nThe take away was, when a task called for rudimentary cognitive skills a larger reward led to poorer performance.\\n\\nThis highlights how an extrinsic reward structure that was developed to motivate a workforce in the Industrial Age doesn\'t translate to the modern world. We\'re solving a different set of problems these days and need a different way to motivate.\\n\\nIntrinsic motivators are the leading cause for performance improvement within a cognitive problem space, these motivators can be categorised as:\\n\\n- **Autonomy** - the urge to direct our own lives\\n- **Mastery** - the reward of getting better and better at something that matters to us\\n- **Purpose** - the yearning to contribute something bigger than ourselves.\\n\\nIt\'s important to note that this isn\'t the silver bullet that fixes a company culture, velocity of a team, or attrition rate. \\n\\nA lot of articles have been written [google](https://www.google.com/search?q=extrinsic+motivation+vs+intrinsic+motivation) as well as many [papers and books](https://scholar.google.com.au/scholar?q=extrinsic+motivation+vs+intrinsic+motivation&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart) \\n"},{"icon":"fas fa-balance-scale","iconColor":"#dc5353","slug":"3-things-ive-learnt-this-week-2020-06-28","title":"Customers, High Expectation Customers, and Hicks Law","description":"","date":"2020-06-28","tags":"business, product-management","short_tease":"How to ask, HXC and hicks law","category":"Business and Product Innovation","body":"\\n\\n1. The structure of an ask\\n2. HXC - Define your \'High Expectation Customer\'\\n3. Hicks Law - The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.\\n\\n## The structure of an ask - getting your message right\\n\\nThe development of a structured narrative to fit your audience is critical when you aim to influence, engage, or ask. \\n\\nThis Comes in three parts:\\n1. Who is your audience?\\n2. What are you trying to communicate?\\n3. What is the ask?\\n\\n**Who is your audience?**\\nNate Regier talks about conflict as the gap between what you want and what you are experiencing at any point in time. This is true for your audience also. Understanding your audience is critical. Who are they? What do they value? What are their underlying goals, or mission? What are their anxieties, and concerns?\\n\\n\\n**What are you trying to communicate?** \\nNate Regier says you should also \'lead with open\', or Brene Brown suggested, \'be vulnerable\'. They\'re hovering around the same idea of opening yourself up leads to greater human connection, an important concept.\\n\\nOnce you understand your audience, the key is to find the alignment in your mission and vision with theirs. To do this understand the value you\'re adding in whatever it is your doing. Simon Sinek calls this the \'start with why\'. Lead the conversation with the mission, and the what becomes much easier to frame in the mind of your audience. \\n\\nI\'m not suggesting you change your mission to suit your audience. What I am suggesting is you only adapt the storytelling aspect, find the parts that are common and focus on those. If this part isn\'t nailed, you\'ll quickly find your message will collapse. \\n\\n**What is the ask?**\\n\\nDon\'t overgeneralise and be sure to frame the opportunity succinctly. Don\'t dance around what you\'re after, be as clear as you can when asking for something, and where it makes sense talk about how that will be utilised to push the mission/vision forward. \\n\\ni.e. in pitch decks, you often see \'We\'re asking for introductions to VC\'s to seed our A round to continue our growth into new markets\'. Or in a corporate setting, \'I would like your endorsement to pursue X product opportunity\'. \\n\\n## Hicks Law - Why less is more.\\n\\nHicks law is a simple idea that states, the more choices you present to your users, the longer it will take them to make a decision. It\'s common sense but often neglected in product and UX design. \\n\\nThe equation [(RT = a + b log2 (n))](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law#:~:text=Hick\'s%20law%2C%20or%20the%20Hick,increase%20the%20decision%20time%20logarithmically) developed by a British and an American team (William Edmund Hick and Ray Hayman), who observed the greater the stimulus, the longer the reaction time is to settle on a decision. \\n\\nGreat companies have understood and embraced this law, take for example Google\'s homepage vs Yahoo\'s (of yesteryear), both were providing search as a primary model of business. Google who embraced this offered nothing but a search bar and two buttons, while Yahoo offered search at the top of the page, the weather, latest news, and anything else someone might want. What is a user supposed to do but be distracted? Restaurants are another fine example. Some understand this law and offer a few menu items, while others provide multi-page menu\'s. Sometimes I just want the gnocchi until I see 2 pages of pasta and sauces, and then I\'m no longer so sure, it reduces the satisfaction.\\n\\nHicks Law can be applied to various areas of a business such as:\\n- **Commercial Pricing Model** - (have 3 price points for sign up, rather than a price per feature model). \\n- **UX Design** - The UI can reduce complexity by smart categorisation of choice or obscuring complexity via just-in-time presentation.\\n- **Product Narrative** - In the conversation with users, your product may do a lot for many, but you need to tune the message to the user you\'re currently talking to. I\'ve seen this done well during the signup process where the first question is \'what\'s your role\' which then updates the language, descriptions of features, and value prop. Genius! \\n- **Pitch** - When pitching to investors and potential hires it\'ll be crucial to have a concise non-cluttered story to inspire\\n\\nThere are a [a lot of articles](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=hicks+law) covering Hicks. Happy reading.\\n\\n## HXC - The High Expectation Customer\\n\\nStrategic positioning of a product, company, and brand is a long term bet. Investing the time when you\'re starting a business or before a pivot to identify a market, a customer, and the narrative to take to market is crucial and provides you and the rest of the organisation with North Star.\\n\\nA \'see what sticks\' approach to drive adoption of a company product line will inevitably create a draining environment within the organisation. Alignment at an executive level will be non-existent which trickles down to the employees. The outcome will be less organised roadmaps, a flip-flopping of the target customer, longer meetings and a fragmented company. \\n\\n### So what is the solution?\\n\\nThe first step is to define your ideal customer, coined **the high expectation customer\'**. \\n\\nThe HXC is the most discerning person within your target demographic. It\'s someone that enjoys your product or service and gets great value from it. They aren\'t necessarily your first customers, or your most loyal. \\n\\nTo kick off positioning work, you can ask these style of questions\\n\\n1. Who is the customer that needs/wants your service or product most?\\n2. Why does your product or service matter to them?\\n3. How do they feel about your product or service?\\n4. What is its true benefit to them?\\n5. Will your product exceed their expectations?\\n\\nIf you have a two-sided marketplace like Airbnb, Uber, or Booking.com you\'ll ask those questions for each side of the market. \\n\\nRead more about it with great articles from [Shengyu Chen](https://medium.com/@shengyuchen/high-expectation-customers-hxc-86e9ce60eac4) and [first round](https://firstround.com/review/what-i-learned-from-developing-branding-for-airbnb-dropbox-and-thumbtack/)\\n"},{"icon":"fas fa-seedling","iconColor":"var(--main-growth-color)","slug":"3-things-ive-learnt-this-week-2020-06-19","title":"3 things i\'ve learnt this week","description":"","date":"2020-06-19","tags":"business, product-management","short_tease":"Go to Market Strategy Oprimisation, Challenges facing Teachers, and Market Sizing","category":"Business and Product Innovation","body":"A busy and energetic week is finally coming to a close. This week I concluded week 2 at the Antler Launch Academy while focusing on a growing number of challenges facing educators\\n\\n### 1. Go to market buyer journey can be represented using ToFu, MoFu, BoFu.\\n\\nGo to Market is a complicated beast as we\'re all aware, and identification of an audience, marketing and sales strategy, and having a product with aligned features is just the start. \\n\\n<img src=\'article_images/blog/4.tofumofubofu.png\' width=\'100%\' />\\n\\nToFu -> MoFu -> BoFu framework will help identify the buyer\'s journey, allowing for flexible comms at different points of the decision. \\n\\nIt represents Top of the Funnel, Middle of the Funnel, and Bottom of the Funnel. \\n\\nThe top should represent your awareness stage, the middle is the consideration stage, while the bottom is the decision stage. \\n\\nRead more about it at [hubspot](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/gtm-strategy)\\n\\n\\n### 2. Attrition Rates for Teachers within the first 5 years of their careers are reported as 20% - 40%. \\n\\nAttrition rates in teachers within the first five years of their teaching career is quoted to be anywhere from 20% - 40%. \\n\\nDigging into the why through some qualitative interviews I\'ve found that 3 main themes are consistent:\\n\\n**The Dead Poets Society Moments** are only a small amount of the life of a teacher, some are quoting only 30% of their time is spent in the classroom, the rest is spent in meetings, writing reports and planning. \\n\\n**Class Sizes Matter** There was a report that indicated that class sizes made little difference to the learning outcomes of the students, but it didn\'t tackle the teacher side of the equation. If you have 7 classes at 30 children, you\'ll be splitting your time across 210 students, vs a class at 20, which is only 140 students. \\n\\nFewer reports, less marking, and more time to focus on engagement in the classroom. \\n\\n**Little Support / Lots of Bureaucracy** This seems to be truer in government schools more than private. A good amount of time is spent working around the red-tape of the system to get things done. Classes are underfunded, and teachers often spend their own money to buy content for lessons. \\n\\n\\n### 3. Addressing Total Market Size\\n\\nEnsuring there is a market big enough to grow your product, and suitable adjacent markets for future growth is critical when addressing an idea for a new product line or business. \\n\\n<img src=\'article_images/blog/4.total-addressable-market.png\' width=\'100%\' />\\n\\n\\nEnter, TAM -> SAM -> SOM. \\n\\n**Total Available Market (TAM)**\\n\\nIs the total potential market demand for the product and service and shows the potential scale of the market.\\n\\n**Serviceable Available Market (SAM)**\\n\\nIs the portion/segment of the TAM targeted by your products of services within your immediate reach.\\n\\n**Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)**\\n\\nAlso known as Target Market, is the % of SAM that you can realistically capture.\\n\\nFor example, an Electric Car Manufacture:\\n**TAM** - $amount of the car industry worldwide, include servicing, sales, and aftermarket parts\\n**SAM** - $amount of the car industry in Australia, including all adjacencies\\n**SOM** - $amount of the car industry for electric vehicles in Australia. \\n\\nThe TAM SAM SOM will help identify the opportunity for future growth. \\n"},{"icon":"fab fa-slack","iconColor":"#e6186d","slug":"great-slack-communities-for-innovators-2020-06-13","title":"Great Slack Communities for Innovators","description":"","date":"2020-06-19","tags":"business, product-management","short_tease":"Community is important while innovating, here are a few slack groups that you should be in","category":"Business and Product Innovation","body":"\\n\\nSlack\'s mission was to bring teams together, but when you build great tools they\'ll usually be extended.

This shift in thinking can help identify models within a particular industry that may be more likely to achieve faster growth, lower marginal cost, higher profits, and higher market valuations\\n\\nThe four business model archetypes are as follows:\\n\\n<img src=\'/article_images/blog/02-business-model-archetypes.png\' width=\'100%\' alt=\'business model archetypes\' />\\n\\n**Asset Builders**: \\nThese companies build, develop, and lease physical tangible assets to make, market, distribute, and sell physical things. Examples include Ford, Kmart, and Qantas Airways. They are capital heavy, and costs grow with revenue.\\n\\n**Service Providers**: \\nThese companies hire employees who provide services to customers or produce billable hours for which they charge. Examples include McKinsey, Bain, Even your Lawyer and Accountant. Service Providers are brand reliant for talent and require top-talent acquisition to succeed, man-power heavy scaling with a fixed cost to revenue.\\n\\n**Technology Creators**: \\nThese companies develop and sell intellectual property such as software, analytics, pharmaceuticals, and biotechnology. Examples include Microsoft, Oracle, and to some extend Google. This model offers a lower marginal cost of the product once the initial investment in R&D is realised.\\n\\n**Network Orchestrators**.\\nThese companies create a network of peers in which the participants interact and share in the value creation. They may sell products or services, build relationships, share advice, give reviews, collaborate, co-create and more. Examples include eBay, Visa, Uber, Tripadvisor, and Alibaba. Least expensive to scale as the network contributes products and content.\\n\\n"},{"icon":"fas fa-seedling","iconColor":"var(--main-growth-color)","slug":"optimising-for-growth","title":"Optimising for Growth","description":"","date":"2019-08-28","tags":"product-management","short_tease":"Picking the right growth metric","category":"Business and Product Innovation","body":"\\n While optimising a product for growth it\'s easy to track against new user sign-ups.

The event based architecture that node is built around made for an interesting adventure since our whole team is mainly PHP and Ruby on Rails developers. The first day was spent finding our feet, given the massive amount of nodeJs plugins and frameworks, but by the end of the day we had a good idea of the scope of the technology and more importantly a good idea of how much code we could cut within the remaining 24 hours. We decided to ditch our original idea and move more towards a simple tool that every technologist has been craving! \\n\\nWe called it\xa0[DNS Bot App](http://dnsbotapp.com/) and its primary purpose is to assist you in the propagation of a domain. It works by pinging a variety of root servers all around the globe and building a picture of where your domain is resolving. for this first iteration it will show you A records, but stay tuned for more to come! All in all, Node Knockout was in my opinion a complete success, the goal of the competition was to get a few more people involved in Node and more importantly build some buzz around it. \\n\\nPersonally my goals going into the competition was simply to learn a new language, and although I\'m nowhere near an expert, I really feel I\'ve crossed that first hurdle that exists when learning a new language!

A few people have asked me about how easy it is to roll out their own app, and I\'ve walked a few people though it, and finally decided it warranted a blog post! You\'ll be walked through how to set up: \\n\\n  * Install\xa0[NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/)\\n  * Install\xa0[Node Package Manager (npm)](http://npmjs.org/)\\n  * Install the\xa0[Express](http://github.com/visionmedia/express) framework, and a few other packages\\n\\n### Quick Note\\n\\nI\'m doing this on a mac, but it should be the same on any posix system (linux, bsd, etc) (sorry windows, but if you want to be a serious developer, and .Net isn\'t doing it for you, then change your OS) So lets get this started! \\n\\n## Install NodeJS\\n\\nVisit the\xa0[NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) website and download the latest node package. It\'ll come in tar.gz format. At the time of writing this, its node-v0.2.0.tar.gz. So I\'ll pull it down, and install it! On the console do: \\n\\n```bash\\nwget http://nodejs.org/dist/node-v0.2.0.tar.gz\\ntar xvf node-v0.2.0.tar.gz\\ncd node-v0.2.0\\n./configure\\nmake\\nsudo make install\\n```\\n\\nThe sudo is required as node installs /usr/local/lib/ Once thats done, check to make sure you have it installed \\n\\n```bash\\nnode --version => 0.2.0\\n```\\n\\n## Install NPM\\n\\nVisit the\xa0[NPM](http://npmjs.org/) site. There is a link to the github repo that has some extra info not on the site. I recommend visiting it and reading the readme.. After you\'ve done that, to install: \\n\\n```bash\\ncurl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh\\n```\\n\\nAnd then check if its installed \\n\\n```bash\\nnpm --version => 0.1.27-11\\n```\\n\\nYou might have a later version, again this was the latest at time of writing. \\n\\n## Express\\n\\nExpress is a sinatra like framework that wraps nodejs. It looks pretty sexy! It uses\xa0[Jade](http://github.com/visionmedia/jade) by default, which is a HAML like templating language. Very sexy indeed. \\n\\n```bash\\nsudo npm install express\\nsudo npm install jade\\n```\\n\\n## Rolling out a new nodejs app!\\n\\nExpress has a few generators, which makes life easier for all involved. \\n\\n```bash\\nexpress my_new_project\\n```\\n\\nGo through the project and have a look at the directories/files. The important one there is the app.js file. This file is used to run your new project! To run your node server run \\n\\n```bash\\nnode app.js\\n```\\n\\nYou can then point the browser at http://localhost:3000 and bingo! \\n\\n### Where to find packages?\\n\\nThere is a good list of hosted\xa0[Addons & Modules](http://github.com/ry/node/wiki/modules).

In a simple use case, you may want to give the user 500 credits in your online store when they signup. Without an observer your User model would look something similar to \\n    \\n    \\n    class User < ActiveRecord::Base\\n       def before_create\\n         self.credits = 500\\n      end\\n    end\\n    \\n\\nWhich is fine, if thats all that is in your model. But once your model starts to grow its generally a good idea to keep the callbacks in a different location! Observers to the rescue! With a Rails Observer your code would look similar to \\n    \\n    \\n    # models/user.rb\\n    class User < ActiveRecord::Base\\n    end\\n    \\n    # models/user_observer.rb\\n    class UserObserver < ActiveRecord::Observer\\n       def before_create(user)\\n         user.credits = 500\\n      end\\n    end\\n    \\n\\nNow tell Rails that you want your observer to be included \\n    \\n    \\n    # config/environment.rb \\n    Rails::Initializer.run do |config|\\n      config.active_record.observers = :user_observer\\n    end\\n    \\n\\nRails will automatically understand that this observer is for the user class based on the name (convention over configuration to the rescue). Although you can also have an observer where the model can\'t be inferred by the name, in this case you can explicitly define the models the observer should be observing. For instance, lets say we have an Audit observer, for a number of models. \\n    \\n    \\n      class AuditObserver < ActiveRecord::Observer\\n        observe :user, :item\\n    \\n        def after_update(record)\\n          AuditTrail.new(record, \\"UPDATED\\")\\n        end\\n      end\\n    \\n\\nThis will observe the user model and on an observed update will create a new audit trail record.

Firstly, I used [Tobi\'s delayed_job](http://github.com/tobi/delayed_job) since it comes with a few extra bits a pieces, like generators and the like. **Install the plugin** You can either install it using the rails command, or use git submodules (which i won\'t cover here) \\n    \\n    \\n    script/plugin install git://github.com/tobi/delayed_job.git\\n    \\n\\n**Generate and run the migration** We\'ll run the generator script to generate our migration and then migrate the database up \\n    \\n    \\n    script/generate delayed_job_migration\\n    \\n\\nWhich will generate a migration that looks like this. Have a read through the file. You\'re probably asking yourself where the object to be run is stored. Its actually stored in the \\"handler\\" field as a sexy yaml field. \\n    \\n    \\n      create_table :delayed_jobs, :force => true do |table|\\n        table.integer  :priority, :default => 0      # Allows some jobs to jump to the front of the queue\\n        table.integer  :attempts, :default => 0      # Provides for retries, but still fail eventually.\\n        table.text     :handler                      # YAML-encoded string of the object that will do work\\n        table.string   :last_error                   # reason for last failure (See Note below)\\n        table.datetime :run_at                       # When to run. Could be Time.now for immediately, or sometime in the future.\\n        table.datetime :locked_at                    # Set when a client is working on this object\\n        table.datetime :failed_at                    # Set when all retries have failed (actually, by default, the record is deleted instead)\\n        table.string   :locked_by                    # Who is working on this object (if locked)\\n        table.timestamps\\n      end\\n    \\n\\n**How to queue mail in your app** Lets say for example we have a AccountsMailer \\n    \\n    \\n    class AccountMailer < ActionMailer::Base  \\n      def confirm(user)\\n        subject       \'Your account has been created\'\\n        recipients    user.email\\n        from          \'you@email.com\'\\n        sent_on       Time.zone.now\\n        content_type  \'text/html\'\\n        body \\"Welcome Aboard\\"\\n      end\\n    end\\n    \\n\\nWe would normally send an email by doing something like this in our controllers \\n    \\n    \\n    AccountMailer.deliver_confirm(@user)\\n    \\n\\nWith delayed job, we can simply do a \\n    \\n    \\n    AccountMailer.send_later(:deliver_confirm,@user)\\n    \\n\\nSo delayed job adds a send_later class method, which takes an AccountMailer class method as its first param, and then the methods params as the next. **How to send the mail** Setting up actionmailer is outside of the scope of this post. So i\'m assuming you have it set up already. The jobs at this stage are being queued in your database, but we haven\'t started any sort of job to process the queue. To start the queue simple run \\n    \\n    \\n    rake jobs:work\\n    \\n\\nYou should see the queue starting to process, or at idle if its empty. This is great, but what happens if the rake task dies for some reason???? Daemons to rescue!!! **Daemonising delayed job queue processor** First install the daemons gem \\n    \\n    sudo gem install daemons\\n\\nNext create a script in your script/ directory.. I called mine delayed_job \\n    \\n    \\n    #!/usr/bin/env ruby\\n    require \'rubygems\'\\n    require \'daemons\'\\n    dir = File.expand_path(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), \'..\'))\\n     \\n    daemon_options = {\\n      :multiple   => false,\\n      :dir_mode   => :normal,\\n      :dir        => File.join(dir, \'tmp\', \'pids\'),\\n      :backtrace  => true\\n    }\\n     \\n    Daemons.run_proc(\'job_runner\', daemon_options) do\\n      if ARGV.include?(\'--\')\\n        ARGV.slice! 0..ARGV.index(\'--\')\\n      else\\n        ARGV.clear\\n      end\\n      \\n      Dir.chdir dir\\n      RAILS_ENV = ARGV.first || ENV[\'RAILS_ENV\'] || \'development\'\\n      require File.join(\'config\', \'environment\')\\n      \\n      Delayed::Worker.new.start\\n    end\\n    \\n\\nSave that, and you can now simple do the below to start the queue. \\n    \\n    \\n    script/delayed_job start\\n    \\n\\nI would recommend reading up on the delayed_job and daemons extensions to understand the inner workings, but at least this is enough to get you up and running! notes You can also clear the queue by running \\n    \\n    \\n    rake jobs:clear"},{"icon":"fas fa-gem","iconColor":"var(--main-ruby-color)","slug":"how-to-alias-a-class-method-in-ruby","title":"How To Alias A Class Method In Ruby","description":"","date":"2010-03-30","tags":"ruby","short_tease":"It\'s obvious once you see how it\'s done","category":"development","body":"\\nTo alias a class method, you can\'t just use the alias/alias_method methods.

I also run a forum written in php. I want to build apps for my php (vbulletin) forum, but I didn\'t want to do cross site database calls. I wanted my plug ins to be as independent as possible from the main vbulletin app.. In another website I\'ve been writing, there are three components that interconnect to each other using activeresource! Since it was so easy to implement I thought I\'d give it a go cross programming language! Heres how I did it! First in PHP create your restfull program! I called mine rest.php :) I know very original! Using a sexy XML library I created for php. From this simply class, I can easily create from a select from a database my xml! \\n    \\n    \\n    fetch_array($result);\\n            $xml->openTag(\\"user\\");      \\n    \\n            foreach ($user as $tag => $value) {\\n                $xml->addfield($tag, $value);\\n            }\\n            $xml->closeTag();\\n        }\\n        echo $xml->build();\\n    ?>\\n    \\n\\nSo far so good! So if we go to file.php?user=1 we should get the user with id 1.. You could add all sorts of cool things here. But this is just an example to get you guys going. Now finally ensure you have mod_rewrite working in apache! now if your php file is called rest.php, you\'ll need this rewrite rule to make the magic happen. Just add it to a .htaccess file, or in your vhost RewriteRule ^/rest/users/(.*) /rest.php?user=$1 In your rails app, now create a model named User, e.g. models/user.rb, and add \\n    \\n    \\n    class User < ActiveResource::Base\\n      self.site = \\"http://domain.com/rest/\\"\\n    end\\n    \\n\\nand don\'t forget your corresponding controller. This will now fetch all requests from our rest.php file. If you need any help, please drop me a line! Now for our rails app in our model if we have set up \\n    \\n    \\n    class User < ActiveResource::Base\\n      self.site = \\"http://domain.com/rest/\\"\\n    end\\n    \\n\\nAnd we can simply do this in our rails app! You\'ll see below the find method on the user model, and the resulting url it\'ll call. \\n    \\n    \\n    User.find(:all)      # http://domain.com/rest/users.xml\\n    User.find(1)        # http://domain.com/rest/users/1.xml\\n    User.find(100)    # http://domain.com/rest/users/100.xml\\n    \\n\\nSo if your doing an :all, the app will look for model.xml. If your doing any other call, it\'ll look for model/?.xml.

Here is the design pattern I\'ve found most effective. \\n\\nEach android application extends from the Application, it shares various characteristics of a Singleton, but fundamentally isn\'t a Singleton in the traditional sense. There are various discussions on stackoverflow discussing the finer semantics of this, but we\'ll just accept that this works, and begin.\\n\\nBy extending the Application class we can store application specific information. \\n\\n```java\\n\\npublic class Game extends Application {\\n  private int score = 0;\\n  private boolean gameLoaded = false;\\n\\n  public Game() {\\n    if(!gameLoaded) {\\n      // Init your game, build isometric tile maps, or start to define your level\\n      gameLoaded = true;\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  public void incrementScore() {\\n    score++;\\n  }\\n\\n  public int getScore() {\\n    return score;\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThen in your Activity you can simple call getApplicationContext() which returns a game object to store state, and interact. \\n\\n\\n```java\\n\\npublic class MainActivity extends Activity {\\n  View activityMain;\\n  TextView message;\\n\\n  @Override\\n  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\\n    Game state = ((Game) getApplicationContext());\\n  }\\n\\n  button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {\\n    public void onClick(View v) {\\n      Game state = ((Game) getApplicationContext());\\n      state.incrementScore();\\n      message = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.message);\\n      message.setText(state.getScore());\\n    }\\n  });\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis is by far the easiest way to store state of your application which isn\'t re-run everytime during screen rotation (orientation changes) or loading different views.

I think it should\\n\\n* Adhere to an MVC standard\\n* Have an Admin interface with basic authentication\\n* be backed by MySQL\\n* have Views/Templates (we\'ll use mustache)\\n\\nThe source code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/markgandolfo/clojure-blog)\\n\\nFirst install [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) so we can start to build a clojure app! \\n\\n## Create the project\\n\\n      $ lein new compojure blog\\n\\nCompojure is a nifty clojure library that provides some routing. It\'ll parse the path in the URL and call a function.\\nThe above command will give us a basic scaffold which we can begin to build our app around. The most important directory is the /src directory, this is where we\'ll put all of our code. \\n\\nFirst lets start the server \\n\\n    $ lein ring server\\n\\nGo to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and make sure it works. You should see a Hello World message!\\n\\n## Lets get started!\\n\\nFirst lets run through the target state anatomy of the app \\n\\nThere will be a couple of files and directories we will work with to adhere to MVC, most aren\'t there yet, but we\'ll create them as we move forward\\n\\n`/src/blog/handler.clj`\\n\\nOur routes will go in handler.clj, this is also the main file that gets called when we run our server.\\nIt\'ll look like this after the generation\\n\\n```clojure\\n// src/blog/handler.clj\\n\\n(ns blog.handler\\n  (:use compojure.core)\\n  (:require [compojure.handler :as handler]\\n            [compojure.route :as route]))\\n\\n(defroutes app-routes\\n  (GET \\"/\\" [] \\"Hello World\\")\\n  (route/resources \\"/\\")\\n  (route/not-found \\"Not Found\\"))\\n\\n(def app\\n  (handler/site app-routes))\\n```\\n\\n\\n`/src/blog/controllers/` This directory will hold all of all controllers and actions which will be called from the handler.clj routes file\\n`/src/blog/models/` This directory will hold the models which will store business logic  and more importantly a gateway to external data, be it from a database, document store or a web service. \\n`/resources/views/` This directory will hold our moustache views.\\n\\n### Routes\\n\\nIn the `/src/blog` directory you should see a `handler.clj` file, this is where we\'re going to store our routes, and we\'ll create a few directories where we store controllers, models and views. We\'ll do this a little in this tutorial. \\n\\nIf you open up `handler.clj` you\'ll find a route \\n\\n```clojure\\n(GET \\"/\\" [] \\"Hello World\\")\\n```\\n\\nBreaking this down, it\'s listening to a GET request, at path \\"/\\" in the URL, it\'s not expecting any params [] to be past through and it\'ll return the response \\"Hello World\\". You could change \\"Hello World\\" to be another string, reload your browser to see the change.\\n\\n\\n### Create a posts controller & index action\\n\\nEach controller will respond to several RESTful actions, \\"index, show, new, create, edit, update, destroy\\". If coming from an MVC framework these will be very familiar, if not hang in there, it\'ll make sense soon. \\n\\nLets start by create the directory `/src/blog/controllers/` and a new file in that directory called `posts.clj\'.\\n\\nFor now, lets start by creating a function that we\'ll use to respond to the root path \\"/\\".\\n\\n```clojure\\n\\n;; /src/blog/controllers/posts.clj\\n\\n(ns blog.controllers.posts)\\n\\n(defn index [] \\"Hello, from index\\")\\n```\\n\\n#### Index action to start with\\n\\nNow lets tell the route \\"/\\" to use the newly created index action in the posts controller. \\nTo do this we\'ll do two things in the `handler.clj`\\n\\n1. Import the controller so all actions/functions are available in our handler.clj file\\n2. In place of the string \\"Hello World\\" have the \\"/\\" route use our new index action\\n    \\nBelow are the two changes:\\n\\n```clojure\\n\\n;;/src/blog/handler.clj\\n(ns blog.handler\\n  (:use compojure.core)\\n  (:require [compojure.handler :as handler]\\n            [compojure.route :as route]\\n            [blog.controllers.posts :as posts-controller])) ;<-- add this line\\n\\n(defroutes app-routes\\n  (GET \\"/\\" [] (posts-controller/index)) ;<-- update this line\\n  (route/resources \\"/\\")\\n  (route/not-found \\"Not Found\\"))\\n\\n(def app\\n  (handler/site app-routes))\\n```\\n\\nStart the server again and load the app, you should now see \\"Hello, from index\\"\\n\\n    $ lein ring server\\n\\n#### Create the template for the posts, index controller\\n\\nSo that was easy, with a few lines of code we\'ve managed to render a controller with a string, although easy, it wasn\'t very impressive.. It would be much more impressive if we could render a template file full of html in place of our \\"Hello, from index\\" String. \\n\\nTo do this there will be four things we need to do:\\n\\n1. Add the clostache to the project dependencies\\n2. Create the mustache template\\n3. Add some render helper methods \\n4. Modify the posts controller index function to render the template\\n\\nLets do it. \\n\\nIn the `project.clj` file at the root of your project you need to add the dependency for clostache. This will let lein know what dependencies to download to run the application\\n\\n```clojure\\n\\n;;/project.clj\\n\\n(defproject blog \\"0.1.0-SNAPSHOT\\"\\n  :description \\"FIXME: write description\\"\\n  :url \\"http://example.com/FIXME\\"\\n  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure \\"1.5.1\\"]\\n                 [compojure \\"1.1.6\\"]\\n                 [de.ubercode.clostache/clostache \\"1.3.1\\"]]  ;<-- add this line\\n  :plugins [[lein-ring \\"0.8.10\\"]]\\n  :ring {:handler blog.handler/app}\\n  :profiles\\n  {:dev {:dependencies [[javax.servlet/servlet-api \\"2.5\\"]\\n                        [ring-mock \\"0.1.5\\"]]}})\\n```\\n\\nNext lets create the directory `/resources/views/posts/` where we\'ll store the templates and create the template `index.mustache`\\n\\n```html\\n\\n\x3c!-- /resources/views/posts/index.mustache --\x3e\\n<html>\\n    <head>\\n        <title>Hello World</title>\\n    </head>\\n    <body>\\n        <div class=\\"container\\">\\n            <h1>Hello, {{ name }}</h1>\\n        </div>\\n    </body>\\n</html>\\n```\\n\\nAdd the render methods:\\n\\nIn order to keep the codebase DRY we should be adding these to a controller-helper file, but for the purpose of this tutorial we\'ll add them to the `/src/blog/controllers/posts.clj` file\\n\\nThe below functions will read a template and render it, beware that if the file doesn\'t exist it\'ll render a \\n\\n```clojure\\n\\n;;/src/blog/controllers/posts.clj\\n\\n(ns blog.controllers.posts\\n  (:require\\n    [clostache.parser :as clostache]))\\n\\n(defn read-template [template-name]\\n  (slurp (clojure.java.io/resource\\n    (str \\"views/posts/\\" template-name \\".mustache\\"))))\\n\\n(defn render-template [template-file params]\\n  (clostache/render (read-template template-file) params))\\n\\n...\\n```\\n\\nNow simply we\'ll update the index action in our posts controller, and swap out the `\\"Hello, from index\\"` to the below\\n\\n\\n```clojure\\n\\n;; /src/blog/controllers/posts.clj\\n\\n...\\n(defn index []\\n  (render-template \\"index\\" {:name \\"clojure developer\\"}))\\n```\\n\\nReloading the webpage you should see that our HTML has rendered with our template replacement variable \\"name\\"\\n\\n\\n## But what about the data? Lets add a model\\n\\nHere we\'ll need to do a few things:\\n\\n1. Add the mysql dependencies in project.clj\\n2. Create a db, and a posts table\\n3. Create a posts model\\n4. Fill it with some methods to help pull content out of a db\\n5. update the index.mustache file\\n6. update the posts.clj to pass to use the model\\n\\nMigrations are out of scope of this tutorial, so create a `blog` database with a `posts` table, the table should have the following fields:\\n\\n```sql\\n\\nid:integer\\ntitle:varchar(254)\\nbody:text\\ncreated_at:datetime\\nupdated_at:datetime\\n```\\n\\nNow we have a database, add the following jdbc & mysql connector dependencies to our `project.clj` file\\n\\n```clojure\\n\\n;; /src/project.clj\\n\\n(defproject blog \\"0.1.0-SNAPSHOT\\"\\n  :description \\"FIXME: write description\\"\\n  :url \\"http://example.com/FIXME\\"\\n  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure \\"1.5.1\\"]\\n                 [compojure \\"1.1.6\\"]\\n                 [org.clojure/java.jdbc \\"0.3.0-alpha5\\"]       ;<-- add this line\\n                 [mysql/mysql-connector-java \\"5.1.25\\"]        ;<-- add this line\\n                 [de.ubercode.clostache/clostache \\"1.3.1\\"]]\\n  :plugins [[lein-ring \\"0.8.10\\"]]\\n  :ring {:handler blog.handler/app}\\n  :profiles\\n  {:dev {:dependencies [[javax.servlet/servlet-api \\"2.5\\"]\\n                        [ring-mock \\"0.1.5\\"]]}})\\n```\\n\\n\\nNext lets add the directory `/src/blog/models/` with the file `posts.clj`\\n\\nIn the `posts.clj` file we need to add some requires statements, the mysql-db connector and the all function. \\n\\n```clojure\\n\\n;; /src/blog/models/posts.clj\\n\\n(ns blog.models.posts\\n  (:refer-clojure :exclude [get])\\n  (:require [clojure.java.jdbc :as j]\\n            [clojure.java.jdbc.sql :as s]))\\n\\n(def mysql-db {:subprotocol \\"mysql\\"\\n               :subname \\"//localhost:3306/blog\\"\\n               :user \\"root\\"\\n               :pass \\" \\"\\n               :zeroDateTimeBehaviour \\"convertToNull\\"})\\n\\n(def now\\n  (str (java.sql.Timestamp.

Reload the browser and you should see the posts!\\n\\n### Lets set up an admin controller\\n\\nWhat\'s the point of having a blog without an admin? Hang on now, we\'ll be going a little bit faster with less explanation. But if you\'ve got this far I think you\'ll get it!\\n\\nWhat we\'ll be doing here is:\\n\\n1. Add an admin controller with CRUD actions\\n2. Create the admin routes in a protected-routes function\\n3. Add basic auth to the protected-routes \\n4. Add the Admin views\\n\\nLets add the `/src/blog/controllers/admin/posts.clj` controller with the actions required to CRUD.\\n\\n```clojure\\n;; /src/blog/controllers/admin/posts.clj\\n\\n(ns blog.controllers.admin.posts\\n  (:require\\n    [clostache.parser :as clostache]\\n    [blog.models.posts :as posts-model]))\\n\\n(defn read-template [template-name]\\n  (slurp (clojure.java.io/resource\\n    (str \\"views/admin/posts/\\" template-name \\".mustache\\"))))\\n\\n(defn render-template [template-file params]\\n  (clostache/render (read-template template-file) params))\\n\\n(defn index []\\n  (render-template \\"index\\" {:posts (posts-model/all)}))\\n\\n(defn show [id]\\n  (render-template \\"show\\" {:post (posts-model/get id)}))\\n\\n(defn edit [id]\\n  (render-template \\"edit\\" {:post (posts-model/get id)}))\\n\\n(defn new []\\n  (render-template \\"new\\" {}))\\n```\\n\\nUpdating the handler.clj file to include basic auth, protected and public routes\\nas well as a group of the admin/posts routes, you\'ll notice we ommited the create/update actions, and instead handle it in the router with the do function. This is personal choice and won\'t always be practical. i.e. if you need to add validation, etc. \\n\\n```clojure\\n;; /src/blog/handler.clj\\n\\n(ns blog.handler\\n  (:use compojure.core)\\n  (:require [compojure.handler :as handler]\\n            [compojure.route :as route]\\n            [ring.middleware.basic-authentication :refer :all]\\n            [ring.util.response :as resp]\\n            [blog.models.posts :as posts-model]\\n            [blog.controllers.posts :as posts-controller]\\n            [blog.controllers.admin.posts :as admin-posts-controller]))\\n\\n(defn authenticated?

We\'ll put this in our `ApplicationController`\\n\\n```ruby\\n# app/controllers/application_controller.rb\\n\\nclass ApplicationController < ActionController::Base\\n  protect_from_forgery with: :exception\\n  helper_method :current_user\\n\\n  def current_user\\n    @current_user ||= User.find(session[:user_id]) if session[:user_id]\\n  end\\nend\\n```\\n\\nWe\'ll use the `SessionsController` to handle the login and logout actions for a user.\\nThe `create` action will be used as the callback url we\'ll give to google, and the `destroy` action will log a user out.\\n\\n```ruby\\n# app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb\\n\\nclass SessionsController < ApplicationController\\n  def create\\n    user = User.from_omniauth(env[\\"omniauth.auth\\"])\\n    session[:user_id] = user.id\\n    redirect_to root_path\\n  end\\n\\n  def destroy\\n    session[:user_id] = nil\\n    redirect_to root_path\\n  end\\nend\\n```\\n\\nNow that we have our controller set up, lets set up some routes.\\nIn your Google Credential set up you would of been asked for Redirect URL\'s,\\nGiven the below routes, you can use whatever domain you wish and the path `/auth/google_oauth2/callback` and `/auth/failure`.\\n\\n```ruby\\n# config/routes.rb\\n\\nget \'auth/:provider/callback\', to: \'sessions#create\'\\nget \'auth/failure\', to: redirect(\'/\')\\nget \'signout\', to: \'sessions#destroy\', as: \'signout\'\\n\\nresources :sessions, only: [:create, :destroy]\\n```\\n\\nI\'d recommend putting some auth stuff in a partial, and including it where it\'s needed.\\n\\n```html\\n# app/views/application/_auth.html.erb\\n\\n<% if current_user %>\\n  Signed in as <strong><%= current_user.name %></strong>!\\n  <%= link_to \\"Sign out\\", signout_path, id: \\"sign_out\\" %>\\n<% else %>\\n  <%= link_to \\"Sign in with Google\\", \\"/auth/google_oauth2\\", id: \\"sign_in\\" %>\\n<% end %>\\n```\\n\\nAnd that\'s omniauth-google sorted. Start the app, and auth yourself so we have a token to play with.\\n\\n#### Gmail Gem.\\n\\nSo the Gmail gem can be auth\'d via a number of methods like username and password, or oauth1 but we\'ll be using oauth2.\\nIt\'s quite simple now to connect to a user\'s account!\\n\\nLoad up your rails console, and put this in!\\n\\n```ruby\\nuser = User.first\\nGmail.connect(:xoauth2, user.email, user.oauth_token)\\n\\n# You should see\\n=> #<Gmail::Client0x7f8f95b6ec58 (users@emailaddress.com) connected>\\n```\\n\\nFrom there you can utilise any of the `Gmail` gem methods. i.e.\\n\\n```ruby\\nuser = User.first\\ngmail = Gmail.connect(:xoauth2, user.email, user.oauth_token)\\ngmail.inbox.count\\n=> 42\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n"},{"icon":"fas fa-gem","iconColor":"var(--main-ruby-color)","slug":"date-amp-time-helper-with-rspec-and-capybara","title":"Date & Time Helper with rspec and capybara","date":"2013-11-17","comments":"true","tags":"ruby, capybara, testing","short_tease":"How to set date and time in capybara tests in rails","category":"development","body":"\\nA set of simple helpers for you to place into ./spec/helpers/helpers.rb, I searched for a while and couldn\'t find an elegent solution, so I quickly whiped this up and thought I\'d share incase anyone else needed a hand. \\n\\nThe first helps select a date from a date and time rails widget\\n\\n```ruby\\n\\ndef select_date_and_time(date, options = {})\\n  field = options[:from]\\n  select date.strftime(\'%Y\'), :from => \\"#{field}_1i\\" #year\\n  select date.strftime(\'%B\'), :from => \\"#{field}_2i\\" #month\\n  select date.strftime(\'%d\'), :from => \\"#{field}_3i\\" #day \\n  select date.strftime(\'%H\'), :from => \\"#{field}_4i\\" #hour\\n  select date.strftime(\'%M\'), :from => \\"#{field}_5i\\" #minute\\nend\\n```\\n\\nTo use it, in your capybara rpsec tests, you can find use it by\\n\\n```ruby\\n\\nselect_date_and_time(DateTime.now, from:published_date)\\n```\\n\\nSimilarly the following helper selects just a date\\n\\n```ruby\\n\\ndef select_date(date, options = {})\\n  field = options[:from]\\n  select date.strftime(\'%Y\'), :from => \\"#{field}_1i\\" #year\\n  select date.strftime(\'%B\'), :from => \\"#{field}_2i\\" #month\\n  select date.strftime(\'%d\'), :from => \\"#{field}_3i\\" #day \\nend  \\n```\\n\\nAnd use it as follows in your tests\\n\\n```ruby\\n\\nselect_date(Date.today, from:published_date)\\n```"},{"icon":"fas fa-gem","iconColor":"var(--main-ruby-color)","slug":"using-to-param-ftw","title":"Using To Param Ftw","description":"","date":"2009-12-17","post_type":"post","tags":"ruby","short_tease":"to_param in ruby to create nice urls","category":"development","body":"\\nI have a client who draws comics.
